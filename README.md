## 🛠 Technology:

- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)  
- **Shadcn UI** (pre-built accessible UI components)  
- **TanStack Query** (data fetching and caching)

### More about technology

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) –** a strongly typed superset of JavaScript. It helps catch errors at compile time, improves code readability, and serves as built-in documentation through type annotations.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) –** a utility-first CSS framework that speeds up UI development by using pre-defined classes directly in markup. It promotes consistency and rapid prototyping.
- **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) –** a collection of accessible and customizable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. It helps create clean, production-ready designs quickly.
- **[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) –** a powerful data-fetching and state management library. It handles caching, background updates, and error handling efficiently without the need for global state.
- **[Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) –** a composable charting library built on React components. It allows developers to easily visualize data with bar charts, line graphs, and more.
- **[OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) –** provides access to current and forecasted weather data. It powers the weather functionality of the app with real-time and accurate data.
